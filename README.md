Title: The Next Big App
Trusty Townies is a single page application designed to help small businesses gain exposure, and connect consumers with locals they can trust. Justin, Brooke, and Julie, the designers of the app, utilized many tools during production including MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS and Node.js), Authentication (bcrypt), MVC architecture, CSS animations, and more; they focused on creating a user-friendly experience accessible to all. In an interview with one of the designers, Justin spoke about some of the challenges he faced during fabrication: "accessing the google map api and getting it to function in the way we intended was one of the biggest challenges for me, however, I knew it would make a big impact for users and I am excited about the way it turned out." It's clear that building an app of this caliber isn't easy, Brooke touched on a similar experience she had with the design of the product; "I faced some challenges with getting certain animations to toggle on and off in the way I wanted, thankfully, it all came together at the end!". As customers, we can be thankful as well, Trusty Townies could be the next big way people from all over the country can connect!
